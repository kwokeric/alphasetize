            Harmonic mixing consists of two elements: knowing the key of
            every song that you play and knowing which keys are
            compatible. Mark Davis created the Camelot wheel, a visual,
            color-coded system to help djs figure out which keys are
            compatible. Each key is assigned a code number from one to
            twelve, like the hours around a clock. If you play a song in
            5A and mix it into a song with a 10A key code, for example,
            youâ€™ll notice the difference immediately. The clashing pitch
            between the two songs creates an uncomfortable dissonance To
            get started, find the keys of your songs.
